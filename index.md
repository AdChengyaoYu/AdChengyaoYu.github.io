## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Chengyao Yu. I am fortunate to have received guidance from Professor Ruixing Ming during my undergraduate studies. I will be joining the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) as a master's student in Fall 2025, where I will be mentored by Professor Bingyi Jing. Iâ€™m excited to work on both theoretical and applied statistical problems, and I hope to engage actively with the broader research community.

## Research Interests

I work on statistical problems related to two main themes:

- Multiple hypothesis testing in various contexts  
- Uncertainty quantification and interpretability in machine learning
