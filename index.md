## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Chengyao Yu. Recently, I join the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) as a master's student in Fall 2025, where I will be mentored by Professor Bingyi Jing. Iâ€™m excited to work on both theoretical and applied statistical problems. I hope to engage actively with the broader research community.

## Research Interests

I work on statistical problems related to two main themes:

- Multiple hypotheses testing in various contexts  
- Uncertainty quantification and interpretability in machine learning

Recently, I focus on leveraging conformal inference to assist in reliable deployment of large language models.
