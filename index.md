## About Me

Hi! I’m Chengyao Yu. I am fortunate to have received guidance from Professor Ruixing Ming during my undergraduate studies. I will join the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) as a master's student in Fall 2025, where I will be mentored by Professor Bingyi Jing. I’m excited to work on both theoretical and applied statistical problems, and I hope to engage actively with the broader research community.

## Research Interests

I work on statistical problems related to two main themes:

- Multiple hypotheses testing in various contexts  
- Uncertainty quantification and interpretability in machine learning

Recently, I focus on leveraging conformal inference to assist in reliable deployment of large models.

## Contact

I am open to collaboration and discussion in fields involving multiple hypotheses testing, large language models, and uncertainty quantification (conformal inference).  
Feel free to contact me if you are enthusiastic about these topics as well!
